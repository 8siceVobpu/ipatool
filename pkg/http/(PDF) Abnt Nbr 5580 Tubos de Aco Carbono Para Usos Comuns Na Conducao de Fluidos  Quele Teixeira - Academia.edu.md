Carbon steel tubes are made of an alloy of iron and carbon, with small amounts of other elements such as manganese, silicon, and sulfur. Carbon steel tubes have high strength and durability, but they are also prone to corrosion and rusting. Therefore, ABNT NBR 5580 requires that carbon steel tubes have a protective coating or lining to prevent corrosion and extend their service life.
 
ABNT NBR 5580 also specifies the methods and equipment for testing the quality and conformity of carbon steel tubes. The tests include dimensional inspection, tensile test, flattening test, bending test, hydrostatic test, and non-destructive test. The tests ensure that the tubes meet the minimum requirements of mechanical properties, chemical composition, surface condition, and leak resistance.
