# What is ABNTNBR15512 and why is it important for biodiesel and diesel BX?
 
ABNTNBR15512 is a Brazilian technical standard that establishes the requirements and procedures for the storage, transport, supply and quality control of biodiesel and/or diesel BX. Biodiesel and diesel BX are fuels that contain a blend of biodiesel (a renewable fuel derived from vegetable oils or animal fats) and petroleum diesel. The standard aims to ensure the safety, efficiency and environmental performance of these fuels in different applications.

In this article, we will explain what ABNTNBR15512 covers, how it differs from other standards, and what benefits it brings to the biodiesel and diesel BX industry.
  
## What does ABNTNBR15512 cover?
 
ABNTNBR15512 covers the following aspects of biodiesel and diesel BX:
 
- Storage: The standard specifies the conditions and equipment for storing biodiesel and diesel BX in tanks, containers, drums or other systems. It also defines the criteria for sampling, labeling, inventory control and emergency procedures.
- Transport: The standard establishes the requirements for transporting biodiesel and diesel BX by road, rail, waterway or pipeline. It also provides guidelines for loading, unloading, handling, documentation and accident prevention.
- Supply: The standard determines the conditions and equipment for supplying biodiesel and diesel BX to vehicles, generators or other consumers. It also sets the parameters for measuring, dispensing, verifying and reporting the quality and quantity of the fuels.
- Quality control: The standard defines the methods and limits for testing the physical, chemical and biological properties of biodiesel and diesel BX. It also specifies the frequency, procedures and records for quality control activities.

## How does ABNTNBR15512 differ from other standards?
 
ABNTNBR15512 is based on international standards such as ISO 4259 (Petroleum products - Determination and application of precision data in relation to methods of test), ISO 8217 (Petroleum products - Fuels (class F) - Specifications of marine fuels) and IEC/CISPR 11 (Industrial, scientific and medical equipment - Radio-frequency disturbance characteristics - Limits and methods of measurement). However, it also incorporates specific requirements and adaptations for the Brazilian market and regulations.
 
Some of the main differences between ABNTNBR15512 and other standards are:

- The standard allows a wider range of biodiesel content in diesel BX, from B2 (2% biodiesel) to B100 (100% biodiesel), depending on the application and availability. Other standards usually limit the biodiesel content to B5 or B7.
- The standard requires a higher cetane number (a measure of ignition quality) for biodiesel and diesel BX than other standards. The minimum cetane number for biodiesel is 51 and for diesel BX is 48. Other standards typically require a minimum cetane number of 47 or 49.
- The standard includes specific tests for biodiesel stability, oxidation stability, microbial contamination and cold flow properties that are not required by other standards. These tests are important to ensure the performance and durability of biodiesel and diesel BX in different climatic conditions.

## What benefits does ABNTNBR15512 bring to the biodiesel and diesel BX industry?
 
ABNTNBR15512 brings several benefits to the biodiesel and diesel BX industry, such as:

- It ensures the quality and safety of biodiesel and diesel BX throughout the supply chain, from production to consumption. This reduces the risks of accidents, malfunctions, emissions and environmental impacts.
- It promotes the use of renewable fuels that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. This contributes to the goals of sustainable development and energy security.
- It creates a common technical language and reference for biodiesel and diesel BX producers, distributors, suppliers, consumers and regulators. This facilitates communication, cooperation and compliance among different stakeholders.
