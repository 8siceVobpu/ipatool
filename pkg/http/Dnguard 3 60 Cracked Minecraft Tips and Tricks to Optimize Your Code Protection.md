# How to Use DNGuard to Protect Your Minecraft Mods
 
If you are a Minecraft modder, you may want to protect your code from being reverse engineered by others. One way to do that is by using DNGuard, a .NET obfuscator and code protection tool that offers protection against advanced code tampering techniques[^2^].
 
DNGuard works by transforming your .NET assemblies into a form that is hard to read and understand, while preserving the functionality and performance of your code. It also encrypts your strings, resources, and metadata to prevent leakage of sensitive information.

## Step 2: Add Your Minecraft Mod Assembly to DNGuard
 
The next step is to add your Minecraft mod assembly to DNGuard. An assembly is a file that contains your compiled code, usually with the extension .dll or .exe. You can find your mod assembly in the bin folder of your mod project.
 
To add your mod assembly to DNGuard, launch the program and click on the Add button on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can browse and select your mod assembly. Click Open to add it to the project list.
 
## Step 3: Configure the Protection Settings
 
The third step is to configure the protection settings for your mod assembly. DNGuard offers various options and features that you can customize according to your preferences and requirements. Some of the most important ones are:
 
- **Obfuscation:** This option enables or disables the obfuscation of your code. Obfuscation makes your code harder to read and understand by renaming your classes, methods, fields, properties, events, etc. with random or meaningless names.
- **Control Flow Obfuscation:** This option enables or disables the control flow obfuscation of your code. Control flow obfuscation alters the structure and logic of your code by adding jumps, branches, loops, switches, etc. that confuse decompilers and debuggers.
- **String Encryption:** This option enables or disables the encryption of your strings. String encryption converts your strings into encrypted byte arrays that are decrypted at runtime. This prevents anyone from seeing or modifying your strings in plain text.
- **Resource Encryption:** This option enables or disables the encryption of your resources. Resource encryption encrypts your embedded resources such as images, sounds, fonts, etc. that are stored in your assembly.
- **Metadata Reduction:** This option enables or disables the reduction of your metadata. Metadata reduction removes unnecessary or redundant information from your assembly such as attributes, custom attributes, debug symbols, etc.

You can access these options by clicking on the Settings button on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can check or uncheck the options you want. You can also adjust the level of protection for each option by using the sliders.
 
## Step 4: Protect Your Minecraft Mod Assembly
 
The final step is to protect your Minecraft mod assembly with DNGuard. To do that, click on the Protect button on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can choose a destination folder for your protected assembly. Click Save to start the protection process.
 
DNGuard will then apply the protection settings you have configured to your mod assembly and generate a new protected assembly in the destination folder. You can check the progress and status of the protection process in the log window at the bottom of the program.
