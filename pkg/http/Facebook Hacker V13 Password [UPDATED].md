One of the common techniques that hackers use to exploit online accounts is called credential stuffing. This is when they obtain a single pair of username and password from a data breach or other sources, and then try to use it to log into various websites and services. They do this because they know that many people tend to use the same credentials for different accounts, such as social media platforms, streaming services, or banking websites. This makes it easier for hackers to access multiple accounts with minimal effort.

Credential stuffing can have serious consequences for both individuals and businesses. For individuals, it can lead to identity theft, financial loss, or compromised personal information. For businesses, it can result in data breaches, reputational damage, or legal liability. According to a report by Akamai, credential stuffing attacks accounted for nearly 30% of all malicious login attempts in 2018.
  
One of the best ways to prevent credential stuffing is to use strong and unique passwords for each account. A strong password is one that is long, complex, and unpredictable. A unique password is one that is not used for any other account. This way, even if one account is compromised, the others will remain secure. Another way to protect online accounts is to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires an additional verification step besides the password, such as a code sent to a phone or an email.
