To use Delphi 2014 R3, you need to have a compatible interface such as Autocom or Delphi DS150E. You also need to activate the software with a keygen that can generate a valid license for your hardware. In this article, we will show you how to download and install Delphi 2014 R3 and how to use the keygen to activate it.
 
## Step 1: Download Delphi 2014 R3
 
You can download Delphi 2014 R3 from various sources on the internet, such as torrent or MEGA links. For example, you can use this link[^1^] to download it from MEGA. The file size is about 2.5 GB and it contains the software for both cars and trucks.
 
After downloading the file, you need to extract it to your C: drive using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should have a folder named "DS150E\_CAR\_2014.R3" or "DS150E\_TRUCKS\_2014.R3" depending on which software you want to install.
 
## Step 2: Download and Apply the Patch
 
The next step is to download and apply the patch that will allow you to use the keygen to activate the software. You can download the patch from this link[^2^]. The patch contains two files: ACSecurity.dll and Main.exe. You need to copy these files and paste them into the folder where you extracted Delphi 2014 R3, replacing the original files.
 
For example, if you want to install Delphi 2014 R3 for cars, you need to copy ACSecurity.dll and Main.exe from the patch folder and paste them into C:\DS150E\_CAR\_2014.R3, overwriting the existing files.

## Step 3: Run Main.exe and Generate Hardware Key
 
Now you are ready to run Main.exe from the folder where you installed Delphi 2014 R3. You can double-click on it or right-click and choose "Run as administrator". This will open a window like this:

In this window, you need to enter your serial number of your interface. You can find it on a sticker on your device or on the packaging. It should be a 6-digit number starting with 10 or 20.
 
After entering your serial number, you need to click on the arrow button next to it. This will generate a hardware key (HWID) that is unique for your interface. You need to copy this hardware key and save it somewhere for later use.
 
## Step 4: Download and Run Keygen
 
The final step is to download and run the keygen that will generate a license file for your hardware key. You can download the keygen from this link[^3^]. The keygen is a file named "Keygen\_2014R3.exe". You need to extract it from the archive using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
After extracting the keygen, you need to run it as administrator. This will open a window like this:

In this window, you need to paste your hardware key that you copied from Main.exe in step 3. Then you need to click on "Generate FileActivation.xml". This will create a file named "FileActivation.xml" in the same folder as the keygen.
