## How to Download and Install Fake SMBX 1.4
 
The fake SMBX 1.4 can be downloaded from various websites that host fan-made games and mods. However, we do not recommend downloading it from these sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
 
The safest way to download the fake SMBX 1.4 is from the official website of the hacker, which can be found here: [https://wohlsoft.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=58&t=385](https://wohlsoft.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=58&t=385). This website is in Russian, so you may need to use a translator to understand it.
 
Once you have downloaded the fake SMBX 1.4, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called "SMBX-38A" that contains the game files.
 
To install the fake SMBX 1.4, you need to copy the folder "SMBX-38A" to your desired location on your computer. You can also rename the folder if you want.
 
To run the fake SMBX 1.4, you need to double-click on the file "smbx.exe" inside the folder "SMBX-38A". You will see a splash screen with the logo of SMBX 1.4 and the name of the hacker.
 
## How to Change Fake SMBX 1.4 to SMBX 1.0
 
If you want to play the real SMBX 1.0 instead of the fake SMBX 1.4, you need to delete some files from the folder "SMBX-38A". These files are:
