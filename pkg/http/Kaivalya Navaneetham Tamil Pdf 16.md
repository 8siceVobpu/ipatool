Advaita Vedanta is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, which accept the authority of the Vedas and the Brahma Sutras. Advaita Vedanta is also one of the three main sub-schools of Vedanta, along with Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) and Dvaita (dualism). Advaita Vedanta is based on the teachings of various sages and teachers, such as Yajnavalkya, Uddalaka, Gaudapada, Govinda Bhagavatpada, and most importantly, Shankara, who is regarded as the greatest exponent and systematizer of Advaita Vedanta.
 
Advaita Vedanta holds that there is only one reality, Brahman, which is the ultimate cause and essence of everything. Brahman is infinite, eternal, unchanging, and transcendent. Brahman is also identical with Atman, the innermost self of every being. The apparent multiplicity and diversity of the world is an illusion (maya) caused by ignorance (avidya) of the true nature of reality. The goal of human life is to attain liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara) by realizing one's true identity with Brahman. This realization is achieved by a process of discrimination (viveka) between the real and the unreal, detachment (vairagya) from worldly desires and attachments, and cultivation of spiritual virtues (sadhanas). The highest means of knowledge (pramana) for Advaita Vedanta is the scriptural testimony (shruti) of the Vedas and the Upanishads, which reveal the truth of Brahman and Atman. The other means of knowledge, such as perception (pratyaksha), inference (anumana), and analogy (upamana), are valid only in the realm of maya.
