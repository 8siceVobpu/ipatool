The installation may take several minutes depending on your system.
 
## Step 4: Get the Activation Code
 
After the installation is complete, you will need to activate Navisworks Manage 2019 using an activation code. You can get the activation code from one of these sources:
 
- If you have a subscription plan, you can log in to your Autodesk account and go to "Manage Products and Services". You will see a list of your products and their serial numbers and product keys. You can copy the product key for Navisworks Manage 2019 and use it as the activation code.
- If you have a free trial version, you can request an activation code from Autodesk by filling out a form with your name, email address, country, and product information. You will receive an email with the activation code within a few minutes.
- If you have downloaded Navisworks Manage 2019 from another source, you may need to use a keygen program to generate an activation code. A keygen is a software that creates random codes for software activation. However, using a keygen may be illegal and risky, as it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your data. We do not recommend using a keygen for Navisworks Manage 2019.

## Step 5: Enter the Activation Code
 
Once you have the activation code, you can launch Navisworks Manage 2019 from your desktop or start menu. You will see a window asking you to activate your product. You can choose between online or offline activation. Online activation requires an internet connection and is faster and easier. Offline activation requires you to generate a request code and enter a response code from Autodesk.
 
For online activation, you just need to enter your serial number and product key (or activation code) and click on "Activate". You will see a message confirming that your product has been activated successfully.
 
For offline activation, you need to click on "Request an Activation Code" and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to copy the request code and paste it into a web browser on another computer that has internet access. You will then need to log in to your Autodesk account and enter the request code into a form. You will receive a response code that you need to copy and paste back into Navisworks Manage 2019. You will then see a message confirming that your product has been activated successfully.
