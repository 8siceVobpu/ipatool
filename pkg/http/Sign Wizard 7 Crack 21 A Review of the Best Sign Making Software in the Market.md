- Effects Library: This library contains hundreds of special effects that you can apply to your text or objects with a few clicks, while retaining full editing capabilities. You can also add your own effects to the library.
- Image Fill Tool: This tool lets you fill any object with an image from a library of 100 great fills or your own images. You can create stunning graphics with this feature.
- Easy Bevel Tool: This tool creates scalable bevels with a simple vector-based tool that uses feathering to achieve a realistic effect. You can also edit the text after applying the bevel.
- Dynamic Outline, Shadow, and Contour Cut Paths: These tools give any object an outline, a shadow, or a contour cut path that is automatically recreated when the path changes, including text editing, font changes, etc. This saves you time and hassle when there are last-minute changes to the design.

Now that you have learned some of the features of Sign Wizard 7, let's see how you can use it to create a professional sign for your business. In this example, we will create a sign for a pizza restaurant called "Pizza Wizard".
 
First, open Sign Wizard 7 and create a new document with the size and resolution that you want for your sign. You can also choose a background color or image for your sign.
 
Next, use the Text Tool to type "Pizza Wizard" in a large font. You can choose any font that you like, but we recommend using a bold and catchy font that matches your brand. You can also adjust the color, size, and alignment of your text.
 
Then, use the Effects Library to apply some effects to your text. For example, you can use the Image Fill Tool to fill your text with a pizza image from the library. You can also use the Easy Bevel Tool to give your text some depth and dimension. You can experiment with different effects and combinations until you find the one that suits your style.
 
Next, use the Paragraph Text Tool to add some information about your restaurant below your main text. For example, you can type "Best pizza in town", "Open daily from 11 am to 10 pm", or "Call us at (123) 456-7890". You can also use the Effects Library to apply some effects to your paragraph text, such as shadow, outline, or glow.
 
Then, use the Image Tool to insert some images that complement your sign. For example, you can add some pizza slices, a chef hat, or a wizard hat. You can resize, rotate, and position your images as you like. You can also use the Effects Library to apply some effects to your images, such as feathering, transparency, or distortion.
 
Finally, use the Dynamic Contour Cut Paths Tool to create a contour cut path around your sign. This will help you cut out your sign from the vinyl or other material that you are using. You can adjust the offset and shape of your contour cut path as you like.
 
That's it! You have created a professional sign with Sign Wizard 7. You can preview your sign on the screen or print it out to see how it looks. You can also save your sign as a file or export it to another application. You can also make any changes or edits to your sign at any time.
