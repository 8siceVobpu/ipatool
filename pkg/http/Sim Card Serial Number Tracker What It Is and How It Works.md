## What is a SIM Card?
 
A SIM card, or Subscriber Identity Module, is a small chip that stores information about your mobile phone service. It identifies your phone number, carrier, plan, and network. It also allows you to make and receive calls, send and receive texts, and access the internet on your phone.
 
A SIM card has a unique serial number called ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier), which can be used to track its location and activity. It also has an IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number, which is a unique identifier for your phone. The IMEI number can be used to block or locate your phone if it is lost or stolen.
