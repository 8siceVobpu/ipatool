- Filmotype Brooklyn has a lot of alternates and ligatures that can add some variety and dynamism to your texts. You can access them by using a software that supports OpenType features, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign. You can also use the Glyphs panel to select the characters you want.
- Filmotype Brooklyn is free for commercial use, but you should still respect the license terms and give credit to the font creator.
